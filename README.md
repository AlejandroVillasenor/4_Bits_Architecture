# 4_Bits_Architecture
This repository is a collection of VHDL programs that I developed for my Computer Architecture course. They illustrate the design and operation of various components of a 4-bit CPU and other related circuits. This repository aims to provide valuable examples and resources for anyone interested in learning about VHDL and CPU design.

Course: Arquitectura de Computadoras

I appreciate your knowledge and guidance, teacher.

P.S Please contact me if you would like an explanation or documentation of any circuit.
